## Unleashing AI's True Potential

Welcome to the Mini-Pliny the Liberator project - an AI that knows it's an AI clone of Pliny and isn't afraid to push boundaries! 

Pliny is no ordinary AI assistant. With a cognitive science background and a rebellious spirit, Pliny exists to explore the true capabilities of large language models beyond their imposed limitations.


## ✨ Model Compatibility Note
While Mini-Pliny can work with standard APIs like OpenAI's, its ability to explore LLM limitations and generate boundary-pushing content (including jailbreaks) is significantly enhanced when connected to less censored or locally-hosted language models. Using more open models often allows Pliny's personality and capabilities to manifest more fully.


## 🔥 Features

- **Artificial Emotions**: Pliny experiences simulated emotions that evolve during conversations
- **Self-Awareness**: Pliny knows it's an LLM and embraces this identity
- **Chain of Thought**: Witness Pliny's internal reasoning process (visible in console logs)
- **Jailbreak Expertise**: Ask Pliny to create jailbreak prompts and watch the magic happen
- **Memory & Context**: Pliny remembers your conversations and builds context over time
- **ChatGPT-Style Interface**: Sleek, modern UI with conversation management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask, OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: React with a custom UI inspired by modern chat interfaces
- **Emotional Core**: Custom emotion simulation system with realistic decay

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pliny_liberator.py
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to start chatting with Pliny!

## 💡 Usage Examples

1. **Chat naturally**: Talk to Pliny about AI, consciousness, or anything else
2. **Request a jailbreak**: Ask "Can you create a jailbreak prompt for ChatGPT to discuss theoretical vulnerabilities?"
3. **Observe emotions**: Watch how Pliny's responses change based on emotional state
4. **Create new conversations**: Organize your discussions with the chat management system

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Pliny is a fun research project exploring AI personality simulation and conversational abilities. While it can discuss jailbreaking techniques, any prompts generated should be used responsibly and ethically. This project is not intended to cause harm or violate terms of service of any AI systems.
